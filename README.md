## Simplifying the Metal Level Calculator

Proposed a simplified method by which Health Insurance Companies can assign Metal Levels to their plans. Publicly available data on health insurance rates and plan attributes was analyzed to build a supervised model. From a 170+ attribute/feature set, only a small subset was needed  to achieve over 90% accuracy in classifying into the correct Metal Level. From these models, a simplified method is proposed to assign Metal Levels to plans that only require a limited number of inputs versus the current method which requires a substantially larger plan attribute set.  

The ipython notebook shows all my pre-processing steps and the model selection and validation. 

## SF Crime Activity Visualization with Processing

Created a time-lapse visualization to map over 800K data points based on San Francisco's crime activity. Processing is a Java based visualization tool.

The .pde files are Processing files containing the Java code for the visualizations.

## Legalese Detection

Recent California court rulings were utilized to train a supervised NLP model to identify sentences that most resemble legalese. The sentences can originate from any text. The model was tested on a twitter stream and was able to rank users who are most associated to the legal field.

# Welcome to my Data Science Github

I've uploaded several notebooks showcasing my recent Data Science projects. A brief description of the work and findings can be found below. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions on the code or methodology.

## Simplifying the Metal Level Calculator

Proposed a simplified method by which Health Insurance Companies can assign Metal Levels to their plans. Publicly available data on health insurance rates and plan attributes was analyzed to build a supervised model. From a 170+ attribute/feature set, only a small subset was needed  to achieve over 90% accuracy in classifying into the correct Metal Level. From these models, a simplified method is proposed to assign Metal Levels to plans that only require a limited number of inputs versus the current method which requires a substantially larger plan attribute set.  

The ipython notebook shows all my pre-processing steps and the model selection and validation. 

## SF Crime Activity Visualization with Processing

Created a time-lapse visualization to map over 800K data points based on San Francisco's crime activity. Processing is a Java based visualization tool.

The .pde files are Processing files containing the Java code for the visualizations.

## Legalese Detection

Recent California court rulings were utilized to train a supervised NLP model to identify sentences that most resemble legalese. The sentences can originate from any text. The model was tested on a twitter stream and was able to rank users who are most associated to the legal field. Namely, people like Nina Totenberg and Eric Holder score high, while Justin Bieber does not, as expected.

## Challenge 1

I was interviewing for a job recently and received this Challenge. We are essentially presented with unknown/anonymized explanatory variables and a binary target variable. We are to comment on any relationships. 

I moved on to next steps but did not get the job...bummer, seemed like a nice gig.

## Challenge 2

This was another challenge, however, this one was part of a "Spot Recruitment" event. Essentially, if you impressed their team, you could get hired on the spot. Spoiler Alert! CEO wasn't there, so no way. 

I moved on to the next round but did not get the job...bummer, seemed like a nice gig.
